# Predictive Analytics for Sales Forecasting

## Overview

This project provides a complete workflow for predicting future sales using machine learning techniques. The repository is designed to help analysts and businesses harness historical sales data, perform rigorous analyses, and build robust models for forecasting, supporting smarter inventory, marketing, and resource planning.



## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, data formatting, and preparing features for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding seasonality, identifying trends, visualizing sales patterns.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating time-based, categorical, and external features (e.g., promotions, holidays).
- **Model Building:** Implementation of ML regressors (Random Forest, XGBoost, LGBM, etc.) and time series methods (ARIMA/SARIMAX/Prophet).
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Using grid search and cross-validation for model optimization.
- **Model Evaluation:** Reporting metrics such as RMSE, MAE, R², and generating plots for actual vs. predicted sales.
- **Deployment:** Example scripts/notebooks for making predictions with new data.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nandkumarcoder/Predictive-Analytics-for-Sales-Forecasting.git
cd Predictive-Analytics-for-Sales-Forecasting
```

### 2. Installation

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Prepare Data

- Place your raw sales data (CSV) in the directory.
- Ensure columns like `date`, `sales`, `store_id`, `product_id`, `promotion`, etc., exist or are created.

### 4. Run Analysis & Modeling

Explore and preprocess data in the Jupyter notebooks inside . For model training and testing, run the scripts in the `scripts/` directory.

Example:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/data_exploration.ipynb
python scripts/train_model.py
```

### 5. Review Results

- Model metrics and forecasted values are output to the `results/` folder.
- Visual comparisons of actual vs. predicted sales, feature importance, and residual analysis are included.

## Detailed Workflow

| Step                | Description                                                                   |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data Collection     | Import historical sales, promotions, external data (weather, holidays).       |
| Data Cleaning       | Remove/handle missing and anomalous entries.                                  |
| EDA                 | Analyze seasonality, outliers, and feature distributions.                     |
| Feature Engineering | Time-based features (month, week), lag features, promo flags, holiday flags.  |
| Modeling            | Regression and/or time series algorithms (Random Forest, XGBoost, ARIMA).     |
| Tuning/Evaluation   | Cross-validation, grid search, reporting RMSE, MAE, R².                      |
| Forecasting         | Predict future sales and visualize with confidence intervals.                 |
